          Crossplane does not currently have enough maintainers to address every
          issue and pull request. This issue has been automatically marked as
          `stale` because it has had no activity in the last 90 days. It will be
          closed in 7 days if no further activity occurs. Leaving a comment will
          remove the `stale` label and prevent the issue from being closed. Note
          that it may take this bot several hours to react to comments.
