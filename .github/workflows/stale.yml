        # We currently have ~150 stale issues because we just enabled the action
        # and many old issues were marked stale at once. The action uses ~2
        # operations per stale issue per run to determine whether it's still
        # stale. It also uses 2-3 operations to mark an issue stale or not.
        # Once we've burned through our initial backlog of stale issues it will
        # most likely be safe to lower this to ~100 or even fewer operations.

          Crossplane does not currently have enough maintainers to address every
          issue and pull request. This issue has been automatically marked as
          `stale` because it has had no activity in the last 90 days. It will be
          closed in 7 days if no further activity occurs. Leaving a comment will
          remove the `stale` label and prevent the issue from being closed. Note
          that it may take this bot several hours to react to comments.
